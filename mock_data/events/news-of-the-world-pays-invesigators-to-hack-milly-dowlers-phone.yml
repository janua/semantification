:synopsis: >-
  <p>It was revealed that the business secretary told two undercover reporters he had "declared war" on Rupert Murdoch and said: "I think we are going to win."</p>
:summary: >-
  <p>The News of the World illegally targeted the missing schoolgirl Milly Dowler and her family in March 2002, interfering with police inquiries into her disappearance, an investigation by the Guardian has established.</p>
  <p>Scotland Yard is investigating the episode, which is likely to put new pressure on the then editor of the paper, Rebekah Brooks, now Rupert Murdoch's chief executive in the UK; and the then deputy editor, Andy Coulson, who resigned in January as the prime minister's media adviser.</p>
