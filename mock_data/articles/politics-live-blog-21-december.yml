      <p>What does Jeremy Hunt think about the way television is regulated in the UK? My colleague Tara Conlan has sent me some comments from <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/6577489/Tories-plan-Big-Bang-revolution-in-media.html">a speech Hunt gave last year</a>. This is what Hunt said:</p>
      <blockquote class="quoted"><p>It is why no major international players have come forward to buy ITV and major US networks are not interested in investing in Britain. They are driven away by regulations which are strangling our creative media industries. We will strip away the regulations in the same way that Big Bang revolutionised the City to make it the major financial centre of the world ...</p><p>Because our regulation is stuck in the pre-internet dark ages, we have left our media industries exposed and vulnerable to huge market shocks. It has taken the combination of a bitter advertising recession and the structural changes wrought by the internet for this to sink home.</p><p>The start must be massive reform of the cross-media ownership rules for local media operators. We need to allow media operators more flexibility to own businesses operating on both the same and different platforms.</p></blockquote>

      <p>Vince Cable has issued a statement about Cameron's decision to reprimand him and strip him of the News Corporation portfolio.</p>
      <blockquote class="quoted"><p>I fully accept the decision of the prime minister and deputy prime minister. I deeply regret the comments I made and apologise for the embarrassment that I have caused the government.</p></blockquote>

      <p>Cable survives - but only just. He has been reprimanded by Downing Street, and he has lost responsibility for any decisions relating to the News Corporation bid for BSkyB. Jeremy Hunt, the culture secretary, will take charge of this.</p>
      <p>This is a serious embarrassment. Robert Peston was making the point earlier that the News Corporation takeover is the biggest going on in Britain at the moment. A business secretary without the ability to get involved in that will look emasculated, Peston suggested.</p>
      <p>Sky's Adam Boulton has just said that he thinks Vince Cable's reprieve may be a short one. David Cameron said recently that he wants David Laws back in government soon. The standards and privileges committee is due to publish its report on the expenses allegations that led to Laws's resignation from cabinet earlier in the new year. Provided that its criticisms are not severe, Laws should be free to return to government. Boulton thinks Laws will become the business secretary at some point next year.</p>
      <p>David Cameron managed to get this sorted out before the start of the 6pm news. As Downing Street crisis management goes, that's pretty nifty work.</p>

#<p id="block-61"><time>5.45pm:</time> Downing Street has just issued this statement.</p><blockquote class="quoted"><p><br>Following comments made by Vince Cable to the Daily Telegraph, the prime minister has decided that he will play no further part in the decision over News Corporation's proposed takeover of BSkyB.</p><p>In addition, all responsibility for competition and policy issues relating to media, broadcasting, digital and telecoms sectors will be transferred immediately to the secretary of state for culture, media and sport.</p><p>This includes full responsibility for OFCOM's activities in these areas.</p><p>The prime minister is clear that Mr Cable's comments were totally unacceptable and inappropriate.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 60 --><p id="block-60"><time>5.35pm:</time> Nick Robinson is saying that Vince Cable will not leave the cabinet. He thinks Cable will remain as business secretary. But he thinks that Cable will have to give up responsibility for the News Corporation decision.</p><!-- Block 59 --><p id="block-59"><time>5.34pm:</time> Nick Robinson is reporting that Cable won't leave the cabinet, the PM programme says.</p><!-- Block 58 --><p id="block-58"><time>5.30pm:</time> In<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/oct/27/vincent-cable-liberal-democrats"> a Guardian interview two years ago</a> Stuart Jeffries suggested that Vince Cable wielded more political power when he was working in the Kenyan finance ministry when he was in his 20s (see 5.22pm) than at any time afterwards. This is what Cable said about the experience.</p><blockquote class="quoted"><p>I arrived shortly after independence when many of the expatriates had left. To my embarrassment I had more of a say in the running of a country than I should have done. I was one of these bright young Cambridge graduates who had perhaps too high an opinion of myself. It was a fantastic experience - whether it was any good for the Kenyans I don't know.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 57 --><p id="block-57"><time>5.22pm:</time> Andrew Mitchell has just arrived at Downing Street,<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/BBCLauraK/statuses/17263576632791040"> according to the BBC's Laura Kuennsberg. </a>She's wondering if he will be the new business secretary?</p><p>I've just called the business department. They don't know what's going on.</p><p>If Mitchell does replace Cable, will Cable take his job at the department for international development? That would be a demotion, but, as an appointment, it would have a certain logic. The department for international development is a much more powerful department than it was 10 years ago. And Cable's first job was as a finance officer in the Kenyan Treasury in the 1960s.</p><!-- Block 56 --><p id="block-56"><time>5.12pm:</time> The Tory MP Philip Davies has just told Radio 4's PM programme that he does not see how Vince Cable can remain in charge of decisions relating to News Corporation. "The whole point of ministers making these kind of decisions is that they are supposed to remain scrupulously impartial and without prejudice before the decision comes to them," Davies said. </p><p>Davies also said he did not understand why Cable would want to declare war on Rupert Murdoch anyway.</p><blockquote class="quoted"><p>Why on earth would one want to declare war on a businessman who employs thousands of people, is good for the economy and provides his customers with what they want?</p></blockquote><!-- Block 55 --><p id="block-55"><time>5.06pm:</time> The Tory MP Douglas Carswell has put a post <a href="http://www.talkcarswell.com/show.aspx?id=1726">on his blog</a> saying that he is cheering for Murdoch in his "war" with Vince Cable.</p><blockquote class="quoted"><p>We must not get angry with Vince.  Instead we must laugh at his absurdity. </p><p>Murdoch's "empire", however, is the product of millions of free citizens willingly paying for products and services that Murdoch provides them.  And doing so not through coercion - the way the BBC is funded - but freely from what remains of their own salaries and wages after Vince and co have helped themselves to it through taxation.</p><p>Politicians like Mr Cable and I are only able to do all the things we claim to be able to do because of the wealth creators like Murdoch.  We should not forget it.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 54 --><p id="block-54"><time>4.58pm:</time> Tim Montgomerie<a href="http://conservativehome.blogs.com/thetorydiary/2010/12/cable-cannot-remain-business-secretary.html"> at ConservativeHome</a> thinks David Cameron should try the job swap option. (See 4.46pm.)</p><blockquote class="quoted"><p>Ken Clarke should become Business Secretary and - at the same time - lose responsibility for prisons where he is taking the Coalition down a dangerous path.</p><p>Jeremy Hunt could become Justice Secretary and Cable could move to Culture, Media and Sport (where he wouldn't rule on BSkyB).</p><p>In an ideal world David Laws would return but he cannot do so until he has been exonerated by the parliamentary commissioner for standards.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 53 --><p id="block-53"><time>4.46pm:</time> If David Cameron and Nick Clegg are trying to work out what to do about Vince Cable, what are their options? Here are some quick thoughts.</p><p>• Cable resigns? This would draw a line under the controversy very easily. But replacing him would not be easy. Jeff Randall on Sky has just been floating the idea of Philip Hammond taking over. But you would need another Lib Dem in the cabinet. And Cable on the backbenches would be a serious loss to the Lib Dem arm of the coalition.</p><p>• A job swap? Cable swaps jobs with Chris Huhne or Danny Alexander. This would enable Cameron and Clegg to keep Cable in the cabinet, while addressing concerns about Cable no longer being able to deal with the News Corporation bid for BSkyB.</p><p>• Cable stays, but lets another minister take responsibility for News Corporation decisions? I don't see why this should not happen, although there would still be rumblings about Cable's influence over the department. It is not unheard of for a secretary of state to recuse himself from a decision on the grounds of a conflict of interest.</p><p>There's a fourth option - doing nothing - but I can't see that happening now.</p><!-- Block 52 --><p id="block-52"><time>4.42pm:</time> This is from <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/BBCLauraK/statuses/17258365407207424">the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg.<br></a></p><blockquote class="quoted"><p>I hear Clegg is talking to Vince Cable at the moment</p></blockquote><!-- Block 51 --><p id="block-51"><time>4.35pm:</time> Earlier I said that some Labour MPs have been speaking up for Cable. But others have been quite critical. Here's Denis MacShane<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/ChrisBryantMP/statuses/17253011218759680"> on Twitter.</a></p><blockquote class="quoted"><p>Vince cannot stay as man who "independently" makes ruling on merger/takeover when he has sao blatantly shown his prejudice. Has to go</p></blockquote><p>And here's Kevin Brennan <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/KevinBrennanMP/statuses/17252742179332097">on Twitter.</a></p><blockquote class="quoted"><p>Cable's position is untenable - Poor judgement, lack of integrity, fundamental breach of ministerial code.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 50 --><p id="block-50"><time>4.26pm:</time> Here's a summary of where we are.</p><p><strong>• Vince Cable's cabinet career is in the balance.</strong> David Cameron, Nick Clegg, George Osborne and Danny Alexander are thought to be in Downing Street now discussing his future, following the revelation that Cable told two undercover reporters from the Daily Telegraph that he had "declared war" on Rupert Murdoch. As business secretary, Cable has to take decisions about News Coporation's bid for the whole of BSkyB in a quasi-judicial capacity. Cable's comments leave him open to the chage of bias.<br><strong><br>• Labour's John Denham has suggested Cable should be sacked.</strong> (See 4.09pm.)</p><p><strong>• News Corporation has said it is "shocked and dismayed" by Cable's comments. </strong>(See 4.05pm.)</p><!-- Block 49 --><p id="block-49"><time>4.20pm:</time> Some Labour MPs are speaking up for Vince Cable.</p><p>This is from Chris Bryant <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/ChrisBryantMP/statuses/17253011218759680">on Twitter.</a></p><blockquote class="quoted"><p><br>Cable can't survive. No credibility now, much as I applaud his position on sky and Murdoch.</p></blockquote><p>And this is from Tom Watson<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/tom_watson/status/17237625555390464"> on Twitter.</a></p><blockquote class="quoted"><p><br>Murdoch: The only think vince cable is right on and now he'll probably have to resign for it. What a total shower. Hopeless.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 48 --><p id="block-48"><time>4.17pm:</time> There are a lot of posts on the Twittersphere claiming that Vince Cable has resigned. But Downing Street and the business department have both told me that, as far as they know, he is still business secretary.</p><!-- Block 47 --><p id="block-47"><time>4.09pm:</time> John Denham, the shadow business secretary, has strongly suggested that Cable should be sacked. He's issued this statement.</p><blockquote class="quoted"><p>These comments call into question Vince Cable's capacity to exercise properly his responsibilities in this quasi-judicial process. He must immediately step aside from any involvement with the decision on News Corp's bid to take total control of BSkyB.<br> <br>In light of the grave doubts that will inevitably be raised about Vince Cable's integrity and judgment it is very difficult to see how David Cameron and Nick Clegg can continue to have confidence in him as Business Secretary.<br> <br>Labour called on Vince Cable to intervene in this case and refer it to Ofcom so that that both sides of the argument could be scrutinised. But every company - big or small - that comes up in front of the competition authorities has a right  to know that their case will be heard dispassionately and judged on its merits. Vince Cable, with these extraordinary remarks, has clearly shown he is unable to do that.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 46 --><p id="block-46"><time>4.05pm:</time> Here's the full News Corporation reaction:</p><blockquote class="quoted"><p>News Corp is shocked and dismayed by reports of Mr Cable's comments. They raise serious questions about fairness and due process.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 45 --><p id="block-45"><time>3.57pm:</time> <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/liberaldemocrats/8217253/Vince-Cable-I-have-declared-war-on-Rupert-Murdoch.html">The Telegraph has now put a story about Cable's Murdoch comments on its website</a>.</p><!-- Block 44 --><p id="block-44"><time>3.56pm:</time> News Corporation has said it is "shocked and dismayed" by Cable's comments. It says they raise questions about due process.</p><!-- Block 43 --><p id="block-43"><time>3.55pm</time> And here's a quote from Lord Razzall:</p><blockquote class="quoted"><p>When he says he's at war with the Murdoch press, that's a rather hyperbolic way of saying he's referred this merger with BSkyB to Ofcom. He has not massed his troops on the borders of Twickenham to invade Osterley. What he means is that he's exercised the powers that he has to refer the matter to Ofcom. Ofcom will make a recommendation and presumably he will follow whatever recommendation Ofcom comes up with. He's just done it in a very hyperbolic way.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 42 --><p id="block-42"><time>3.51pm:</time> Lord Razzall, a Lib Dem peer, has just told BBC News that he does not think Cable should have to resign.</p><!-- Block 41 --><p id="block-41"><time>3.48pm:</time> What's going to happen to Cable? The government machine doesn't seem to know yet. "I haven't got anything to say to you now," is what I've just been told by an aide working for Cable. And No 10 hasn't got a line either. "We are not saying anything at the moment," is the word from Downing Street.</p><!-- Block 40 --><p id="block-40"><time>3.36pm:</time> Officials at the Department for Business can't say yet whether Vince Cable is going to give up responsibility for handling decisions relating to the News Corporation bid for BSkyB. "I don't have an answer to that question yet," said a spokeswoman. But she did tell me that Cable hasn't resigned.</p><!-- Block 39 -->
