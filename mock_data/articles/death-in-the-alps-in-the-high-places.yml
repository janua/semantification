  <p>When four climbers, three of them British, died on the descent from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_ascent_of_the_Matterhorn" title="">the conquest of the Matterhorn in 1865</a>, an editorial in <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NdDknCqELzEC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;dq=%22Is+it+allowable?+Is+it+wrong?%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZKXXNW-t5K&amp;sig=nn5W9WENZQlkaUD4ahd6iUhEQaQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ejgAUKTuBci00QWuh4X_Bg&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Is%20it%20allowable%3F%20Is%20it%20wrong%3F%22&amp;f=false" title="">the Times</a> questioned the growing vogue for mountain-climbing. "Is it life? Is it duty? Is it common sense? Is it allowable? Is it not wrong?" the newspaper asked its readers. Queen Victoria was even moved to wonder whether climbing should be banned by law.</p><p>This week, nine mountaineers, three of them again British, were swept to their deaths by an avalanche in the Mont Blanc massif. This time, few have reacted in such introspective terms. We live in a different age from the Victorians. The lost climbers were well equipped and in experienced parties. The human loss is as profound as in any accident of this kind and yet, in an age when every Alp is climbed every day by many people, the collective response is more stoical. Mountains are dangerous. Mont Blanc is dangerous. The climbers were unlucky. But we who remain shall go on climbing.</p><p>It is true that the Alps no longer carry the richly varied cultural meaning in 21st-century Europe that they once did. A century ago, the Alps were still synonymous with muscular individualism, truth, liberty (embodied in the cult of William Tell), simplicity and clarity, "the playground of Europe" in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Stephen" title="">Leslie Stephen</a>'s phrase. The Alps became a place apart from real Europe, a make-believe place of reason, health and justice, the perfect setting for Thomas Mann's reflective novel <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2011/dec/14/winter-reads-thomas-mann-magic-mountain" title="">The Magic Mountain</a>.</p><p>Some of that allure has gone now. Today we live in an era in which almost everyone can travel almost everywhere, and in which extreme sports are commonplace recreation. Those who wish to push the boundaries of endurance and strenuous life are more likely to head to Asia, Antarctica or the Andes now.</p><p>Yet the Alps are still Europe's playground, especially in winter, or when, as this week, the Tour de France rolls through. And still today the mountains draw us to them. To the Victorians, mountains were often a place of spiritual reflection. "From the height of the Weissenstein, I saw, as it were, my religion," wrote <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilaire_Belloc" title="">Hilaire Belloc</a>. A quarter of the original members of the Alpine Club were clergymen (one perished on the Matterhorn in 1865). Even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Pius_XI" title="">the Pope</a> was an Alpinist (though so was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleister_Crowley" title="">Aleister Crowley</a>).</p><p>Today the allure is more eclectic, more individualist, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2011/dec/21/johnny-dawes-interview-rock-climbing" title="">more overtly risk-driven</a>. But the success of a book like <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2003/dec/05/guardianfirstbookaward2003.gurardianfirstbookaward" title="">Robert Macfarlane's Mountains of the Mind</a> shows that the need to go to the high places is as powerful as ever. The climbers who died in the Alps this week revered the mountains to the last. They would almost certainly return there if they could, as those who remain still do and always will.</p>
