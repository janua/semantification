  <p>Here's an evening summary.</p>
  <p><strong>• Vince Cable, the business secretary, has lost considerable authority, and an important part of his ministerial portfolio, after it emerged that he had told undercover reporters from the Daily Telegraph that he had declared war on Rupert Murdoch.</strong> Cable was in a position where he had to take decisions in a quasi-judicial capacity about the attempt by Murdoch's News Corporation to fully take over BSkyB and the comments meant that any decision he took would probably be open to legal challenge. At one stage it looked as if he might be forced to resign. But instead David Cameron reprimanded him, saying his behaviour had been "totally unacceptable and inappropriate". Cameron also said that all responsibility for broadcasting competition policy would be transferred from the business department to the department for culture, media and sport.</p>
  <p><strong>• Jeremy Hunt, the culture secretary, has got a bigger job. His department has just taken over responsibility for an important area of economic policy.</strong> The Downing Street statement (see 5.45pm) suggests that this is permanent. But at least <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/johnmcternan/statuses/17280878753349632">one Labour figure</a> has questioned whether the Enterprise Act allows the culture secretary to take decisions relating to broadcasting competition policy.</p>
  <p><strong>• Rupert Murdoch has emerged as a winner.</strong> Can you imagine a Labour minister ever boasting about declaring war on Murdoch? Or a Tory minister? But Cable was serious about taking on the media mogul. The war didn't last long. Murdoch won.</p>
  <p><strong>• And the Lib Dems have emerged as losers.</strong> When the coalition was formed, they had five cabinet ministers. Of those five, one, David Laws, has resigned (although he is tipped for a return of some kind) and another, Cable, has been badly damaged.</p>
  <p>That's it for today. Thanks for the comments.</p>
