    <p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/jude-law" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Jude Law">Jude Law</a> knew something was very wrong. From early 2003 to at least 2006, the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/newsoftheworld" title="More from guardian.co.uk on News of the World">News of the World</a> seemed to have no limit to the highly private and personal information it knew about him, his friends and family.</p>
    <p>The articles, it is true, contained a lot of inaccurate information, but for the most part every piece published in what was then Britain's best-selling Sunday tabloid contained at least a grain of truth, the source of which Law did not know.</p><p>The impact was profound, Law said on Thursday in a formal statement read out in court by his lawyer, Mark Thomson.</p>
    <p>"For several years leading up to 2006, I was suspicious about how information concerning my private life was coming out in the press. I changed my phones, I had my house swept for bugs but still the information kept being published. I started to become distrustful of people close to me."</p>
    <p>There was the article that referred to phone calls that his assistant, Ben Jackson, had made to Law on arrival at an airport, and stories based on messages he had left for his children's nanny.</p>
    <p>At the same time, Law – and a number of his friends and family – began to experience unusual activity on his mobile phone, including hang-up calls and new messages appearing as old messages. He noticed that journalists and photographers appeared to know his location in advance, meaning he would turn up at meetings or a planned location, only to be faced by a cavalcade of waiting journalists and photographers.</p>
    <p>Law changed his mobile phone several times. He even tried registering them under the names of other people. He hired security consultants to sweep his car for bugs. But to no avail: the articles kept coming – not just in the NoW but in other papers.</p>
    <p>The suspicions began to leak into his personal life: he admits that he began to suspect friends and family of leaking information.</p>
    <p>Then, in June 2010, Law discovered that several of his mobile numbers and the direct dial numbers on them appeared in evidence shown by the Metropolitan police to Sienna Miller as part of her <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2011/may/13/phone-hacking-sienna-miller-news-of-the-world" title="">claim over phone hacking</a>.</p>
    <p>Early in 2011, after Operation Weeting was established, Law was approached by the police and shown evidence that his voicemails had been intercepted including his confidential information.</p>
    <p>He was played a number of recorded messages he had left more than five years ago on the voicemail service of his children's nanny, Jade Schmidt. He had been targeted from at least 2003 to 2006.</p>
    <p>In May 2011, Law issued proceedings against News Group <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/newspapers" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Newspapers">Newspapers</a>, the parent company of the News of the World, for misuse of private information, breach of confidence and harassment. They related to at least 16 articles, from January 2003 to August 2006, suspected to have been based on intercepted voicemail messages.</p>
    <p>NGN initially refused to admit or deny he had been harassed, or that the articles published were derived from intercepted messages. Then, on 13 December 2011, it made a series of extensive general admissions in relation to the interception of voicemail messages. It became clear, as NGN now accepts, that Law had been targeted over a considerable period of time.</p>
    <p>NGN accepts that not only was he subjected to repeated and sustained physical surveillance over a number of years – until at least April 2007 – but that he was regularly pursued in this country and overseas by representatives of NGN. He was doorstepped and put under watch at his home. NGN has also persistently sought and obtained private information about Law and his friends and family through blagging.</p>
    <p>It has become clear – and NGN accept this too – that not only did much of this unlawfully acquired information end up in the numerous articles published about him between 2003 and 2007, but that the information was often inaccurate, distorted and misrepresentative.</p>
    <p>"The effect of this sustained campaign of surveillance, pursuit and harassment, as well as the publication of intrusive and private information, has been profound. It has caused the claimant considerable distress and has caused distrust and suspicion between his friends, family and employees," his lawyer said.</p>
    <p>On Thursday, Law accepted a settlement of £130,000 plus legal costs from News Group, and said he had achieved everything he wanted from the litigation.</p>
    <p>"I hope this means that they will never invade my privacy again. They have also finally given a proper apology," the actor said in a personal statement.</p>
    <p>He said the case, for him, was never about money. "It was about standing up for myself and finding out what had happened. I owed it to my friends and family as well as myself to do this."</p>
    <p>Law said he continues to believe in a free press, "but what News Group [Newspapers] did was an abuse of its freedoms. They have overstepped the mark for many years. They were prepared to do anything to sell their newspapers and to make money, irrespective of the impact it had on people's lives.</p><p>"It was not just those like me, whose work involved them being in the public eye, but also many other people, often at the most vulnerable times of their lives. It is now up to the police and the Leveson inquiry to continue their investigations into tabloid abuses."</p>
    <p>• This article was amended on 6 February 2012 to clarify the statements made by Jude Law. </p>
