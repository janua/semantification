  <p>On hearing that <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/davidcameron" title="More from guardian.co.uk on David Cameron">David Cameron</a> accidentally <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/jun/11/david-cameron-daughter-behind-pub" title="">left his eight-year-old daughter behind in a Buckinghamshire pub</a>, many parents will have tutted disapprovingly. Not me. Tutting is a luxury only afforded to people who haven't done something similar.</p>
  <p>My own shameful lapse happened when our three children were small, the youngest of an age still measured in weeks, but I remember it well enough: after an exhausting and largely unsuccessful trip to the market, my wife is ready to give up, but I am determined to visit the fish shop.</p>
  <p>"I'm taking these two to the playground," she says. "Meet us there." She leaves me at the back of the queue with the pram.</p>
  <p>The pram takes up a lot of room in the queue, so I push it to one side, out of the way of the men hauling boxes of fish across the slippery floor, but close enough where I can keep an eye while I wait.</p>
  <p>I want to be the sort of person who has an easy rapport with fishmongers, but in reality I am the sort of person fishmongers sell unwanted fish to. I'm both highly suggestible and eager to give some impression of expertise. I haven't slept for a month, and I don't know what I want.</p>
  <p>When I walk out of the shop with two big bags, I am worried about how I will explain my purchases to my wife. I am specifically wondering how to answer the question: "Why did you buy two-dozen goose barnacles?" I can't say, "Because I wanted the man to think I knew what they were."</p>
  <p>To my surprise this is not the first question my wife asks me when I show up at the playground. The first question she asks is: "Where is the baby?" For a brief second I have no idea what she's talking about. What baby? Then I drop my barnacles and run, as fast as I can, all the way back to the fish shop.</p>
  <p>By the time I got there the queue was all new people, and I realised they must have all thought someone else in the shop responsible for the pram in the window. My only worry was how I, red-faced and panting, was going to look running in there and snatching a baby. I didn't wait around to find out what anybody thought.</p>
  <p>Having three children is a logistical nightmare. It's easy to lose track of one, especially when you try to divide the labours of parenting. My only advice is: do a headcount every hour or so, and always check the top of your car before you set off.</p>
