    <p>The lawyer acting for the family of the murdered schoolgirl <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/milly-dowler" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Milly Dowler">Milly Dowler</a> has described <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/news-corporation" title="More from guardian.co.uk on News Corporation">News Corporation</a>'s decision to <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2011/jul/13/news-corp-pulls-out-of-bskyb-bid" title="">drop</a> its bid for <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/bskyb" title="More from guardian.co.uk on BSkyB">BSkyB</a> after the hacking scandal as a victory for the public over the multinational media giant.</p>
    <p>Mark Lewis, speaking on behalf of Sally, Bob and Gemma Dowler after they met the prime minister, said the reaction of parliament and News Corp's decision showed that powerful politicians, the press and the police would all be held to account by the "ordinary" public.</p>
    <p>Speaking from Downing Street, with the Dowlers at his side, Lewis reacted to the news about the BSkyB deal being dropped, which was announced while they were in the 45-minute meeting with Cameron. "This shows the power of the public to stand up to something, however big an organisation is, however far-reaching, however worldwide, to stand up and say no, something isn't right," he said.</p>
    <p>"And like most scandals this wasn't about the scandal itself and the underlying conduct, this was about the attempts to cover it up. When people cover up things, they are not fit and proper to run something."</p><p>The family said they were "delighted" with the work that has gone on between the party leaders to set-up a broad <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2011/jul/13/phone-hacking-david-cameron" title="">inquiry</a> since the revelations in the Guardian last week that their daughter <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/jul/04/milly-dowler-voicemail-hacked-news-of-world" title="">Milly's</a> phone had been hacked in the weeks after she went missing and messages deleted so that desperate friends and family could leave more. That action gave the family and police false hope that she might have been alive and picking up messages [see footnote].</p>
    <p>Lewis said: "At the start of this week the Dowler family wanted to have their voices listened to on behalf of them and behalf of Milly and behalf of all the other ordinary victims of unlawful activity by the press. There will now be a full public inquiry for the public, not a political inquiry for the politicians.</p><p>"When the Dowler family first found out about this and when I first met them no one could have known [what would happen]. It's been an earth-shattering week for everyone concerned – for the Dowler family to know actually that the politicians and the people and the public were behind them to say: look, enough is enough, this is too much <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/press-intrusion" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Press intrusion">press intrusion</a>, too much power for one organisation, and people have to stop and listen. It's about the press, police and politicians giving way to the public. The public are speaking."</p>
    <p>The Dowlers met the prime minister along with members of the campaign group Hacked Off, which has been calling for a public inquiry. Martin Moore of Hacked Off welcomed the terms of reference for the inquiry that have just been published by the prime minister. The terms set out one inquiry, in two parts, looking at the hacking revelations and the future for press regulation.</p>
    <p>But he warned: "We raised a concern about part one of the inquiry, particularly that it might be cart before horse if part one was trying to make recommendations without actually learning what had gone wrong first. We also raised concerns about how quickly part two would start. Part two is very much about the investigation itself, going into the news organisation, pulling out some of this material, we felt that should start immediately along with part one."</p>
    <p>• The following was published on 12 December 2011 in the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/series/correctionsandclarifications">corrections and clarifications column</a>: An article about the investigation into the abduction and death of Milly Dowler (News of the World hacked Milly Dowler's phone during police hunt, 5 July, page 1) stated that voicemail "messages were deleted by [NoW] journalists in the first few days after Milly's disappearance in order to free up space for more messages. As a result friends and relatives of Milly concluded wrongly that she might still be alive." Since this story was published new evidence – as reported in the Guardian of 10 December – has led the Metropolitan police to believe that this was unlikely to have been correct and that while the News of the World hacked Milly Dowler's phone the newspaper is unlikely to have been responsible for the deletion of a set of voicemails from the phone that caused her parents to have false hopes that she was alive, according to a Metropolitan police statement made to the Leveson inquiry on 12 December.</p>
